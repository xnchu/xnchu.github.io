I am a research associate at the [Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics](https://lasp.colorado.edu) at the University of Colorado Boulder.

My area of research is space physics, using data analysis, machine learning, numerical simulation, and theoretical analysis to investigate the plasma processes in the Earth's magnetosphere. 

My research interests include: Magnetospheric substorms, geomagnetic storms, radiation belts, machine learning application for science discovery.
