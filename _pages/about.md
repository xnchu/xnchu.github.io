I am a research associate at the [Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics](lasp.colorado.edu) in Boulder, CO.

My area of research is space physics, using data analysis, machine learning, numerical simulation, and theoretical analysis to investigate the plasma processes in the Earth's magnetosphere. 

My research interests include: Magnetospheric substorms, geomagnetic storms, radiation belts, machine learning application for science discovery.
